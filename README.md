AWS Infrastructure Deployment for Automated WordPress Installation

Project Title: AWS Infrastructure Deployment for Automated WordPress Installation

Description:
The task involves building an automated infrastructure on AWS for WordPress installation using Terraform. This project aims to provide a practical learning experience for a DevOps engineer in Terraform and AWS infrastructure provisioning while deploying a functional WordPress instance.

Requirements:

1. Infrastructure Setup: (SK DEV)

Create an AWS account if not already done and configure access credentials.
Select the AWS region for deployment. (eu-central-1)

2. Terraform Learning:

Learn Terraform basics, including its syntax, providers, and resource types.
Utilize available resources and tutorials to develop Terraform skills.

3. Infrastructure Components:

Use Terraform to provision the following AWS infrastructure components:
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Subnets (public and private)
Security Groups
Key Pair for SSH access


4. WordPress Deployment:

Utilize Terraform to automate the deployment of a WordPress instance on AWS.
Configure the WordPress installation to include:
A web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx)
A database server (e.g., MySQL or MariaDB)
PHP support

5. Networking and Security:

Implement security measures within the VPC, such as Network ACLs and Security Groups, to ensure a secure environment.
Define inbound and outbound traffic rules to restrict access to necessary ports.

6. High Availability and Scalability:

Implement strategies for high availability, which may include launching multiple instances in different Availability Zones.
Explore options for scaling the WordPress installation to handle increased traffic.

7. Backups and Recovery: (теоретично)

Configure automated backups for the database to prevent data loss.
Develop a disaster recovery plan for potential infrastructure failures.

8. Monitoring and Alerts:

Set up monitoring of infrastructure and WordPress using AWS CloudWatch or similar services.
Configure alerts to be notified of any performance or security issues.

9. Documentation:

Create comprehensive documentation for the entire project, including Terraform code explanations, infrastructure diagrams, and configuration instructions.
Document how to access and manage the WordPress installation.

10. Testing:
Perform thorough testing of the automated infrastructure to ensure proper functionality.
Validate backup and recovery procedures to ensure data protection.
